< 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O >
========================================
General

At least four different sorting algorithms

What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm

How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input

What is a stable sorting algorithm

Background Context

This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.
